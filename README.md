# REBLUE!! 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code Blooded


### Team Members
- Member 1: Anagha Anilkumar-Model Engineering College
- Member 2: Sreenidhi Ajit--Model Engineering College

### Project Description
REBLUE is an interactive web experience featuring two playful mini-apps:

Box in a Box: A recursive click game where each box spawns another box inside, creating endless nesting with colorful animations.

Savage Table: A drag-and-drop challenge where a sassy table rejects items with humorous, animated responses.

Both apps feature vibrant visuals, sound effects, and smooth interactions for an engaging user experience. 🎮✨

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
REBLUE solves the problem of digital boredom by offering two absurdly entertaining mini-experiences:

Box in a Box addresses the human urge for infinite discovery through compulsive box-clicking, turning mindless repetition into joyful obsession.

Savage Table weaponizes rejection therapy, transforming frustration into laughter as users try (and fail) to please an animated table with attitude.

Both turn unproductive screen time into therapeutic nonsense. 😌💣

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
 REBLUE offers playful digital escapes through two interactive experiences:

Boxception Therapy – Satisfies the brain's craving for satisfying, endless patterns with infinitely nesting boxes that reward each click with visual delight.

Sass-powered Stress Relief – Turns frustration into catharsis by letting users battle a hilariously rude table, transforming failed interactions into comedy.

Basically digital fidget toys for the internet age. 🧠⚡

The REBLUE System Architecture workflow illustrates the integration of various components, 
with JavaScript (including box.js and table.js) handling interactive functionalities. Data flows seamlessly between front-end interfaces, processing modules, and backend services,
ensuring efficient operation and coordination across the entire system.
